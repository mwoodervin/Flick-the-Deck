# Flick-the-Deck

## Overview

Everyone knows the frustration of finally having a free night to relax and watch a movie only to spend more time picking a flick that watching it. Whether you are standing in front of a Red Box dispenser or sitting in your living room clicking through previews, you just want someone to narrow the 10,000 choices down to something manageable so you can get to the Twizzlers and popcorn.

Flick-the-Deck is a light-hearted application that combines the "luck of the draw" with a faster path to movie selection based on user-selected criteria.

## User Story
```
AS a movie watcher
I WANT a simpler way to pick a movie
SO THAT I can spend more time relaxing and watching than scanning and selecting
I WILL shuffle a deck of cards
I WILL enter my movie criteria including maximum runtime, rating and genre
THEN I am presented with 4 cards randomly selected from the deck
WHEN I click on a card, I am presented with 4 movie options fitting my selected criteria
IF I don't like any of those four options
THEN I can draw again up to 12 more times and will be offered 48 more cards with 48 more movie selections behind them
EACH draw presents the user with the top four movies meeting those criteria sorted according to different criteria including popularity in theaters, revenue, release date and vote-count on the MovieDB website.
IF I reach the end of the deck and have not found a movie I want to watch, the application will suggest another activity
```

## Future Development
Future expansion of this application will include features such as
- the ability to link from a movie poster on the site to a movie preview and options for watching
- the ability to flip one card at a time when revealing movie choices
- linking to a paid movie API - our current source has several receognized glitches including inaccurate   ratings and runtimes for movies.
